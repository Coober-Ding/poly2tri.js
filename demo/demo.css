 * Fix Bootstrap's CSS, following angular-bootstrap documentation :
 *   " Original Bootstrap's CSS depends on empty href attributes to style cursors for several components
 *   (pagination, tabs etc.). But in AngularJS adding empty href attributes to link tags will cause unwanted

 *   styling is not applied correctly. The remedy is simple, just add the following styling to your application: "
